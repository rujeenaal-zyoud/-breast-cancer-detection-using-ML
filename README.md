The doctors do not identify each and every breast cancer patient. Thatâ€™s the reason Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist comes into the picture because they have knowledge of maths and computational power.

As ML Engineer, we always retrain the deployed model after some period of time to sustain the accuracy of the model. 
We hope our efforts will save the life of breast cancer patients.
